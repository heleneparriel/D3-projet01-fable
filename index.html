      <h2>The Fox and the Grapes</h2>

      <div class="main-content">
        <div class="text-content">
          <p>One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard
          till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which
          had been trained over a lofty branch.  "Just the thing to quench
          my thirst," quoth he.  Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and
          a jump, and just missed the bunch.  Turning round again with a
          One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success.  Again
          and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to
          give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour."</p>

      <h2>The Fisher and the Little Fish</h2>

    <div class="text-content">
      <p>It happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only
      a little fish.  "Pray, let me go, master," said the Fish.  "I am
      much too small for your eating just now.  If you put me back into
      the river I shall soon grow, then you can make a fine meal off
      me."</p>
      <p>"Nay, nay, my little Fish," said the Fisher, "I have you now.I may not catch you hereafter."</p>

      <p class="fable-moral">A little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing in prospect.</p>

      <h2>The Serpent and the File</h2>

      <div class="main-content">
        <div class="text-content">
      <p>A Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an
      armourer's shop.  As he glided over the floor he felt his skin
      pricked by a file lying there.  In a rage he turned round upon it
      and tried to dart his fangs into it; but he could do no harm to
      heavy iron and had soon to give over his wrath.It is useless attacking the insensible.</p>
